# Architecture

The DoubleZero network is built on a sophisticated architecture designed for high-performance, decentralized network operations optimized for blockchain and distributed systems.

## Network Overview

DoubleZero creates a global mesh network that interconnects contributors and users through optimized routing and data processing infrastructure.

## Core Components

### 1. Network Nodes

**Contributor Nodes**
- Provide network capacity and infrastructure
- Run DZ Protocol software
- Participate in network routing decisions
- Earn rewards for contribution

**User Nodes**
- Connect to consume network services
- Integrate with blockchain systems
- Benefit from optimized data transmission
- Pay for network usage

### 2. DZ Protocol

The DoubleZero Protocol is the core communication layer:

```

**Protocol Features**
- **Version**: DZ Protocol v1.0
- **Transport**: TCP/UDP with custom extensions
- **Security**: TLS 1.3 encryption
- **Authentication**: Public key verification
- **Routing**: Dynamic mesh network routing

### 3. Network Infrastructure
