# FAQs

Common questions about DoubleZero network, services, and technical implementation.

## General Questions

### What is DoubleZero?

DoubleZero is a decentralized framework for creating and managing high-performance decentralized networks, optimized for distributed systems like blockchains. It provides an integrated service for highly-optimized transmission and pre-processing for distributed systems data.

### How does DoubleZero differ from the public internet?

DoubleZero offers two key improvements over the public internet:

1. **Edge filtering**: Inbound transactions are filtered at the network contributor hardware level to remove spam and duplicates
2. **Optimized routing**: Outbound messages are routed more directly and prioritized for improved efficiency

### Who can use DoubleZero?

DoubleZero is designed for:
- **Blockchain validators** requiring high-performance network connectivity
- **RPC infrastructure providers** needing optimized data transmission
- **MEV infrastructure** requiring low-latency connections
- **Distributed systems** benefiting from optimized network performance

## Technical Questions

### What is the DZ Protocol?

The DZ Protocol is DoubleZero's core communication layer that enables:
- High-performance data transmission
- Secure authentication via public keys
- Optimized routing through the network backbone
- Support for both IBRL and multicast modes

### What connection modes are supported?

DoubleZero supports two connection modes:

- **IBRL Mode**: Internet Backbone Routing Logic for optimal performance
- **Multicast Mode**: Efficient data distribution to multiple recipients

### What are the minimum system requirements?

To connect to DoubleZero, you need:
- A blockchain validator client or RPC infrastructure
- Valid public key addresses on your respective ledger
- Network connectivity to the DoubleZero network
- Proper authentication credentials

## Network Questions

### How do I become a network contributor?

To contribute network capacity:

1. **Assess your infrastructure** against DoubleZero requirements
2. **Register your contribution** with the network
3. **Integrate your infrastructure** with the DZ Protocol
4. **Complete validation** and testing

### What infrastructure can I contribute?

Contributors can provide:
- Private fiber links (minimum 1Gbps)
- Network switches and routing hardware
- FPGA devices for network processing
- Strategic geographic locations

### How are contributors rewarded?

Contributors receive token incentives based on:
- Network capacity provided
- Uptime and reliability
- Geographic value
- Active network participation

## Performance Questions

### What performance improvements can I expect?

Typical improvements include:
- **Reduced latency**: Direct routing through optimized backbone
- **Lower jitter**: Consistent connection quality
- **Better throughput**: Optimized for blockchain data patterns
- **Improved reliability**: Bypasses congested internet routes

### How does DoubleZero handle network congestion?

DoubleZero uses:
- Dynamic routing optimization
- Load balancing across network capacity
- Priority handling for critical transactions
- Failover mechanisms for reliability

### What is the network uptime guarantee?

DoubleZero requires 99.9% uptime from contributors and maintains redundant routing paths to ensure high availability.

## Security Questions

### How secure is the DoubleZero network?

Security features include:
- End-to-end TLS 1.3 encryption
- Public key authentication
- Network admission control
- Continuous identity validation
- Role-based access control

### How is my data protected?

Your data is protected through:
- Encrypted transmission at all times
- Secure key exchange protocols
- Network segmentation
