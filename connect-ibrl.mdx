# Connect - IBRL Mode

Internet Backbone Routing Logic (IBRL) mode provides optimal performance for high-frequency blockchain operations by leveraging direct routing through the DoubleZero network backbone.

## What is IBRL Mode?

IBRL mode establishes direct connections through the DoubleZero network's optimized routing infrastructure, bypassing traditional internet routing for improved latency and reliability.

## Configuration

### Network Settings

```bash
# Example IBRL configuration
network_mode: "ibrl"
backbone_routing: true
latency_optimization: true
```

### Connection Parameters

- **Protocol**: DZ Protocol v1.0
- **Port**: 8080 (default)
- **Authentication**: Public key verification
- **Encryption**: TLS 1.3

## Setup Steps

1. **Configure your client**
   ```bash
   # Update your DoubleZero client configuration
   dz config set mode ibrl
   dz config set backbone true
   ```

2. **Verify network connectivity**
   ```bash
   # Test connection to DoubleZero backbone
   dz ping backbone
   ```

3. **Authenticate with the network**
   ```bash
   # Verify your public key
   dz auth verify
   ```

4. **Establish connection**
   ```bash
   # Connect to the network
   dz connect
   ```

## Performance Benefits

- **Reduced latency**: Direct routing through optimized backbone
- **Improved reliability**: Bypasses congested internet routes
- **Better throughput**: Optimized for blockchain data patterns
- **Lower jitter**: Consistent connection quality

## Troubleshooting
