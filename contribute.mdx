# Contribute

DoubleZero contributors provide network capacity in the form of underutilized private fiber links and hardware to extend the global DoubleZero network infrastructure.

## What You Can Contribute

### Network Infrastructure

- **Private fiber links**: Underutilized high-speed connections
- **Network switches**: Enterprise-grade switching equipment
- **FPGA devices**: Field-programmable gate arrays for network processing
- **Routing hardware**: High-performance routers and gateways

### Requirements

To contribute to the DoubleZero network, your infrastructure must meet:

- **Performance standards**: Minimum 1Gbps throughput
- **Reliability metrics**: 99.9% uptime requirement
- **Security compliance**: Enterprise-grade security protocols
- **Geographic distribution**: Strategic network locations

## Contribution Process
